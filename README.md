# Working through *Regression and other stories*

In this project, I'm working through the material in the new text by Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari, [*Regression and other stories*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/regression-and-other-stories/DD20DD6C9057118581076E54E40C372C). You can find the official code from Vehtari at [https://github.com/avehtari/ROS-Examples/](https://github.com/avehtari/ROS-Examples/). I'm really not looking for contributions, at this time. However, if you find gross errors or have concerns, feel free to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ASKurz/Working-through-Regression-and-other-stories/issues).

For each chapter, you can find the raw code in the `.Rmd` files. The `.md` files contain versions of the chapters rendered into HTML using the `github_document` format, which is probably what casual users will be looking for. To my knowledge, there still isnâ€™t a good way to render LaTeX on GitHub, but the `.md` files do an okay job, otherwise.
