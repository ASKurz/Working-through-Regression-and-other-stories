# Working through *Regression and other stories*

In this project, I'm working through the material in the new text by Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari, [*Regression and other stories*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/regression-and-other-stories/DD20DD6C9057118581076E54E40C372C). I'm really not looking for contributions, at this time. However, if you find gross errors or have concerns, feel free to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse_2_ed/issues).
