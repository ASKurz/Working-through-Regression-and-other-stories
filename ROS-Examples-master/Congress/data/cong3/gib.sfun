#    by A. Gelman and D. B. Rubin, in "Statistical Science," to appear.

#                     How to Use These Programs
#
# Preparation:  The results of m multiple sequences, each of length 2n,
#    of iterative simulation (e.g., the Metropolis algorithm or the
#    Gibbs sampler) used to simulate a probability distribution.
#    The starting points of the simulations should be drawn from a
#    distribution that is overdispersed relative to the "target"
#    distribution you are trying to simulate.
#
#    At each iteration, all scalar parameters or summaries of interest
#    should be stored.  The result will be an 2n by m matrix for each
#    scalar summary.
#
# To run:  Use gpar (or gpar.log or gpar.logit) to do output analysis
#    on the simulations for each scalar summary of interest.  For
#    each scalar summary r, gpar produces two results:
#
#       a.  Estimates of the distribution of r,
#       b.  The estimated potential scale reduction;
#           i.e., the factor by which the estimated t intervals for r
#           might decrease if the iterative simulation is continued
#           forever.  As n increases, the scale reduction approaches 1.

# The following S functions are included:

# gpar (Gibbs-parallel) takes a matrix r of simulations:  each of
#       m columns is an independent iteratively simulated sequence of length
#       2n.  The first n steps of each sequence are discarded.
#       Output is a list of three vectors:
#
#       post:  (2.5%, 50%, 97.5%) quantiles for the target distribution
#               based on the Student-t distribution
#       quantiles:  (2.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 97.5%) empirical quantiles of
#               the mn simulated values.
#       confshrink:  50% and 97.5% quantiles of a rough upper bound on
#               how much the confidence interval of "post" will shrink
#               if the iterative simulation is continued forever.
#
#           If both components of confshrink are not near 1, you should
#           probably run the iterative simulation further.

# gpar.log and gpar.logit are versions of gpar to be used for scalar
#       summaries that are all-positive or are constrained to lie
#       between 0 and 1.
